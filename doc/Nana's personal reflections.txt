This is one of the first programing group projects I have participated in and I feel it has been a very enlightening experience. I used to struggle greatly with working with Git and resolving merge conflicts, but after this project I feel more comfortable with sharing code using Git repositories. I thought merging my code with my teammate’s code would be challenging but we were able to put everything together fairly easily. My major problem was that I didn’t have sufficient knowledge of C before I started to code the emulator. This led me to make poor implementations of a few functions because of my lack of understanding of C’s many libraries. This also wasted a lot of time as I had to learn C as I was programming. In future I will ensure to prepare my skills for any projects or tasks I am required to complete.
